# foodTruckLocate application
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript we created a fully functional mobile app
Using Ajax call to Googlemap API and Geolocate we were able to obtain the infomation for our application user
By digging down into the data dump we were able to collect the infromation on your actual loccation, and food trucks within the zipcode you enter
We also added hyper linds for facebook page of most popular, Most fun and family fun trucks 
we also added a few elements such as background image and transparent navbar. 
We could probably add a lot of other functionality and freatures but will have to be done later on
